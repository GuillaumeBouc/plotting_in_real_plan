# plotting_in_real_plan
A simple grapher in the real plan in python with PyTorch, that makes animations with openCV.

## support
- implicit equation
- parametric equation

## support also via parameterization
- one-variable function (from R to R)
- polar equation

### To-Do 
- Find a way to make the `DrawOptions.line_width` argument usable while keep the PyTorch's considerable time savings (I preferred to save time rather than use this argument, if you want to use it, download the last commit of december 3rd (12fdc64))
